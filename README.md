# Bootstrap Portfolio Web Page

This version of my coding portfolio page was updated on 6/2019.  It utilizes modified bootstrap templates as well as CSS styling.  

GitHub repositories of projects referenced on the portfolio page can be accessed here:

Life Relocated: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/Project-1
Pirate Trivia: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/TriviaGame
Gem Hunter: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/Gem-Hunter
Train Scheduler: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/Train-Scheduler
GIPHY Fighters: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/GifTastic
Star Wars Word Game: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/Word-Guess-Game

## Getting Started

This project can be found in my github portfolio here: https://github.com/JoeLearns2Code/Bootstrap-Portfolio
The live page can be found here: https://joelearns2code.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/

### Prerequisites

You will need access to a common web browser to view the live page.  The data can also be pulled directly from GitHub via GitBash on PC or via Terminal on Mac.


### Installing

When you have accessed the repository page on GitHub, you may simply download a Zip file and extract it to a directory of your choosing.  Alternatively, you may download the data directly to your device via GitBash if you have an SSH key.  More on adding an SSH key can be found here: https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

To download via GitBash, once you have a working SSH key with GitHub, create a folder you wish to download data into.  Next, click on the green 'Download or Clone' button on the GitHub respoitory page.  Make sure you have SSH key selected(and not HTTPS), and click on the clipboard icon.  This copies the address to your clipboard.

Next, navigate to the folder you wish to download the data into via GitBash or Terminal, and then simply type "git clone" followed by the link you copied onto your clipboard(paste via ctrl/cmd+v).  Press the enter key, and GitBash will pull the entire repository into your folder.


## Testing

Open files in browser and make sure they are properly formatted. Your eyes are the test.

HTML can be validated here: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input

JS logic can be tested in Chrome by using the Inspect feature, and going to the Console tab. Enter in a function to test the results.

Page scaling can be tested via Chrome using this extension: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/browser-width/mlnegepkjlccabakompdmbcmdieaideh?hl=en-US

The goal of this project was to attempt to get the elements to scale properly in multiple viewports.
